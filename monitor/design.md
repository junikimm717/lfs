# Design.md

Design document for a simple monitor server.

1. a monitor server that takes in a post request (with an api key) to update
   mimux's updated packages, and can also display a badge and also the status of
   packages.
2. Maybe a utility?

# TODO

- [ ] Put a GitHub Action to build this stupid thing
- [ ] Deploy this thing on my vps with an API key
- [ ] Put secrets on the linting CI.

- [ ] Get a nice-looking frontend (you can just get tailwind from the cdn??)
